# Python Practice Tasks

This repository contains my step-by-step Python learning exercises.  
The tasks are organized by week, and each task focuses on a specific programming concept to improve my problem-solving skills and Python proficiency.

## Week Structure

- **Week 1:** Basic Python concepts and simple applications
- **Week 2:** Intermediate Python exercises with loops, conditionals, and built-in functions

## Week 1 Tasks

1. **Student Grade Tracking System** – Store student info, calculate averages, determine pass/fail.
2. **Word Frequency Analyzer** – Count word occurrences in a text, ignoring punctuation and case.
3. **User Registration and Login System** – Validate username, password, email, and age.
4. **Basic Calculator** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with proper handling.
5. **Credit Application Evaluation** – Approve or reject credit based on age and income.
6. **Smart Home Temperature Analysis** – Analyze room temperature comfort, calculate max/min/average, count AC/heating hours.

## Week 2 Tasks

1. **Squares of Numbers** – Create a list of squares for numbers 1 to 10.
2. **Multiplication Table** – Generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10 using nested loops.
3. **Number Guessing Game** – Guess a random number between 1 and 100 with hints and limited attempts.
4. **Sum of Odd Numbers** – Ask the user for 10 numbers and sum only the odd ones.
5. **Zip Function with Index** – Combine two lists and print index, name, and age.
6. **Range Function Practice** – 
   - a) Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100  
   - b) Print numbers from 50 down to 40 in reverse order

## How to Run

- Each task is independent and can be run in any Python environment (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).
- Navigate to the week folder (`Week1/` or `Week2/`) and run the Python file for each task.

## Notes

- This repository is a learning diary to track progress in Python.
- Each task helps practice different concepts: loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, functions, input/output, and built-in Python modules.
