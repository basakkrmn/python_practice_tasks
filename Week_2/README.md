# Python Practice Tasks â€“ Week 2

This folder contains my Python exercises for Week 2. Each task focuses on specific programming concepts, helping me improve problem-solving skills and Python knowledge.

## Tasks Included

1. **Squares of Numbers**
   - Create a new list containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.  
   - Demonstrates use of loops and arithmetic operations.

2. **Multiplication Table**
   - Generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10 using nested loops.  
   - Output is formatted neatly for readability.

3. **Number Guessing Game**
   - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.  
   - User has 10 attempts to guess it. Hints are provided if the guess is too high or too low.  
   - Demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and `random` module usage.

4. **Sum of Odd Numbers**
   - Ask the user for 10 numbers and calculate the sum of only the odd numbers.  
   - Provides real-time feedback when a number is added.  
   - Shows usage of `continue` and loop control.

5. **Zip Function with Index**
   - Combine two lists (names and ages) using the `zip` function.  
   - Print the index, name, and age in a readable format.  
   - Demonstrates `zip` and `enumerate`.

6. **Range Function Practice**
   - a) Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100.  
   - b) Print numbers from 50 down to 40.  
   - Demonstrates the use of `range` with step values, both positive and negative.

## How to Run

- Each task is independent.  
- Open the Python file for each task and run it in your preferred Python environment (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).
