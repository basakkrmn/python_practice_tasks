# Python Practice Tasks – Week 3

This folder contains my Python exercises for Week 3. Each task focuses on specific programming concepts, helping me improve problem-solving skills and Python knowledge.

## Tasks Included

1. **Fibonacci Series with Generator**
   - Create a generator function to produce the Fibonacci series up to a user-defined number `n`.
   - Filter out odd numbers, take the square root of remaining even numbers.
   - Use **lambda** and **map** to process the results.
   - Demonstrates **generators**, **lambda**, **map**, and list processing.

2. **Recursive List Flattening**
   - Flatten a nested list recursively, keeping only numbers and filtering out other types.
   - Use **recursive lambda (Y-combinator)** and **map/filter**.
   - Demonstrates **recursion**, **functional programming**, and data filtering.

3. **Real-Time Data Processing System**
   - Continuously accept numbers from the user.
   - For each input:
     - Add the number to a **stream**.
     - Calculate **moving average** of last 5 numbers.
     - Calculate **standard deviation**.
     - Detect anomalies using the **3-sigma rule**.
   - Program exits when the user types `'quit'`.
   - Demonstrates **generator functions**, **map/reduce**, **lambda**, **exception handling**, and **functional state management**.

4. **Square Root Calculator**
   - Ask the user for a number and calculate its square root.
   - Show error messages for negative numbers or invalid inputs.
   - Demonstrates **try-except blocks** and input validation.

5. **Four-Function Calculator**
   - Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a calculator function.
   - Take operation type and numbers as user input.
   - Handle division-by-zero and invalid operation inputs with **try-except**.
   - Demonstrates **lambda functions**, user input handling, and error management.

6. **Name Formatter**
   - Convert all names in a list to uppercase and prepend `"Sayın "` to each.
   - Accept **comma-separated names** from the user.
   - Use **lambda** and **map**.
   - Demonstrates string manipulation, lambda functions, and list processing.

## How to Run

- Each task is independent.  
- Open the Python file for each task and run it in your preferred Python environment (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).  
- Follow on-screen prompts for input where applicable.
